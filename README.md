## Methods
- Inspected and cleaned data by removing duplicate values, standardizing value counts, explored data outliers, and modified data to correctly assign datatypes.  
- Created univariate and multivariate visualizations to further analyze the overall trends of the dataset.
- Prepare data for Machine Learning modeling.
- Used various regression modeling techniques to gather regression metric data and correlations between features.

## Regression Modeling Scores

**The Best Tuned Model performance on the training data shows an R-squared of 0.604 with a mean square error of 762.69. With the testing data, the model achieved an R-squared of 0.596 and MSE of 737.71.**

**When comparing the training and test scores, we observe that the model performs slightly better on the training data in terms of R-squared. This suggests that the model has successfully learned the underlying patterns in the training data well. There is a small drop in performance on the test data, which is expected as the model encounters new data. This indicates that the model generalizes reasonably well to unseen data and is neither significantly overfit or underfit.**

**Overall, the "Best Tuned" model demonstrates a moderately accurate ability to predict product sales, explaining around 60% of the variability in the sales data. The RMSE value of approximately 1056.04 indicates that the model's predictions have an error of around $1,056.04.**
